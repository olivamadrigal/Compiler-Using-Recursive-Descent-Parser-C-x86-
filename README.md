# Compiler-Using-Recursive-Descent-Parser-C-x86-

DESCRIPTION:
Lab builds a complete compiler implementing a top-down recursive descent parser for a 
right-recursive version grammar. Compiler outputs an x86 assembly file of the program 
using the stack to compute postfix arithmetic expressions. The assembly file produced 
is then compiled into a full program via NASM and gcc which is then executed to output 
the results.
